##5. What is MVC pattern?

MVC is an acronym which stands for 3 words Model - View - Controller. 
Source code model into 3 parts, corresponding to each word. 
Each word corresponds to a separate activity in a pattern.

**Functions of each component in the MVC model:**

**- Model (M):** The part that stores all of the application's data. 
This part is a bridge between two components below is View and Controller.
The model shown in the form is a database.
It shows operations with the database such as retrieving and processing data.

**- View (V):** This is the interface (theme) for the user. 
It is responsible for displaying data and helping users interact with the system.

**- Controller (C):** Controller is responsible for handling user requests through the view. 
From there, Controller gives the data relevant to the user. 
Besides, Controller also has the function to connect to the model.

##6. Activity flow of MVC

- After receiving a request from the browser, Controller will interact with the model to get data. 
The model interacts with the database to get data, 
the returned data is sent back to the Model, from the Model sent back to the Controller, 
the Controller calls View to transfer the data just received from the Model to the View, 
the View will render that data to the browser.
