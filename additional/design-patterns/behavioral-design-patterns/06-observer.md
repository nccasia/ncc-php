#Observer

**Observer is a behavioral design pattern that lets you define a subscription mechanism to notify multiple objects about any events that happen to the object they’re observing.**

An Abstract Factory Pattern includes the following basic components:

1. The Publisher issues events of interest to other objects. These events occur when the publisher changes its state or executes some behaviors. Publishers contain a subscription infrastructure that lets new subscribers join and current subscribers leave the list.

2. When a new event happens, the publisher goes over the subscription list and calls the notification method declared in the subscriber interface on each subscriber object.

3. The Subscriber interface declares the notification interface. In most cases, it consists of a single update method. The method may have several parameters that let the publisher pass some event details along with the update.

4. Concrete Subscribers perform some actions in response to notifications issued by the publisher. All of these classes must implement the same interface so the publisher isn’t coupled to concrete classes. 

5. Usually, subscribers need some contextual information to handle the update correctly. For this reason, publishers often pass some context data as arguments of the notification method. The publisher can pass itself as an argument, letting subscriber fetch any required data directly.

6. The Client creates publisher and subscriber objects separately and then registers subscribers for publisher updates.

Example:
```php
/**
 * PHP has a couple of built-in interfaces related to the Observer pattern.
 *
 * Here's what the Subject interface looks like:
 *
 * @link http://php.net/manual/en/class.splsubject.php
 *
 *     interface SplSubject
 *     {
 *         // Attach an observer to the subject.
 *         public function attach(SplObserver $observer);
 *
 *         // Detach an observer from the subject.
 *         public function detach(SplObserver $observer);
 *
 *         // Notify all observers about an event.
 *         public function notify();
 *     }
 *
 * There's also a built-in interface for Observers:
 *
 * @link http://php.net/manual/en/class.splobserver.php
 *
 *     interface SplObserver
 *     {
 *         public function update(SplSubject $subject);
 *     }

/**
 * The Subject owns some important state and notifies observers when the state
 * changes.
 */

{
    /**
     * @var int For the sake of simplicity, the Subject's state, essential to
     * all subscribers, is stored in this variable.
     */
    public $state;

    /**
     * @var \SplObjectStorage List of subscribers. In real life, the list of
     * subscribers can be stored more comprehensively (categorized by event
     * type, etc.).
     */
    private $observers;

    public function __construct()
    {
        $this->observers = new \SplObjectStorage();

     * The subscription management methods.

    {
        $this->observers->detach($observer);
        echo "Subject: Detached an observer.\n";
    }

    /**
     * Trigger an update in each subscriber.
     */
    public function notify(): void
    {
        echo "Subject: Notifying observers...\n";

            $observer->update($this);
        }
    }

    /**
     * Usually, the subscription logic is only a fraction of what a Subject can
     * really do. Subjects commonly hold some important business logic, that
     * triggers a notification method whenever something important is about to

     */
    public function someBusinessLogic(): void
    {
        echo "\nSubject: I'm doing something important.\n";
        $this->state = rand(0, 10);

        echo "Subject: My state has just changed to: {$this->state}\n";
        $this->notify();
    }
}

/**
 * Concrete Observers react to the updates issued by the Subject they had been
 * attached to.
 */
class ConcreteObserverA implements \SplObserver
{
    public function update(\SplSubject $subject): void
    {
        if ($subject->state < 3) {
            echo "ConcreteObserverA: Reacted to the event.\n";
        }
    }
}

class ConcreteObserverB implements \SplObserver
{
    public function update(\SplSubject $subject): void
    {
        if ($subject->state == 0 || $subject->state >= 2) {
            echo "ConcreteObserverB: Reacted to the event.\n";
        }
    }
}

/**
 * The client code.
 */

$subject = new Subject();

$o1 = new ConcreteObserverA();
$subject->attach($o1);

$o2 = new ConcreteObserverB();
$subject->attach($o2);

$subject->someBusinessLogic();
$subject->someBusinessLogic();

$subject->detach($o2);

$subject->someBusinessLogic();
```
Output:

    Subject: Attached an observer.
    Subject: Attached an observer.
    
    Subject: I'm doing something important.
    Subject: My state has just changed to: 2
    Subject: Notifying observers...
    ConcreteObserverA: Reacted to the event.
    ConcreteObserverB: Reacted to the event.
    
    Subject: I'm doing something important.
    Subject: My state has just changed to: 4
    Subject: Notifying observers...
    ConcreteObserverB: Reacted to the event.
    Subject: Detached an observer.
    
    Subject: I'm doing something important.
    Subject: My state has just changed to: 1
    Subject: Notifying observers...
    ConcreteObserverA: Reacted to the event.
