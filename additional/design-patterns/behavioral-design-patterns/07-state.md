#State

**State is a behavioral design pattern that lets an object alter its behavior when its internal state changes. It appears as if the object changed its class.**

An Abstract Factory Pattern includes the following basic components:

1. Context stores a reference to one of the concrete state objects and delegates to it all state-specific work. The context communicates with the state object via the state interface. The context exposes a setter for passing it a new state object.

2. The State interface declares the state-specific methods. These methods should make sense for all concrete states because you donâ€™t want some of your states to have useless methods that will never be called.

3. Concrete States provide their own implementations for the state-specific methods. To avoid duplication of similar code across multiple states, you may provide intermediate abstract classes that encapsulate some common behavior.

   State objects may store a backreference to the context object. Through this reference, the state can fetch any required info from the context object, as well as initiate state transitions.

4. Both context and concrete states can set the next state of the context and perform the actual state transition by replacing the state object linked to the context.

Example:
```php
/**
 * The Context defines the interface of interest to clients. It also maintains a
 * reference to an instance of a State subclass, which represents the current
 * state of the Context.
 */
class Context
{
    /**
     * @var State A reference to the current state of the Context.
     */
    private $state;

    public function __construct(State $state)
    {
        $this->transitionTo($state);
    }

    /**
     * The Context allows changing the State object at runtime.
     */
    public function transitionTo(State $state): void
    {
        echo "Context: Transition to " . get_class($state) . ".\n";
        $this->state = $state;
        $this->state->setContext($this);
    }

    /**
     * The Context delegates part of its behavior to the current State object.
     */
    public function request1(): void
    {
        $this->state->handle1();
    }

    public function request2(): void
    {
        $this->state->handle2();
    }
}

/**
 * The base State class declares methods that all Concrete State should
 * implement and also provides a backreference to the Context object, associated
 * with the State. This backreference can be used by States to transition the
 * Context to another State.
 */
abstract class State
{
    /**
     * @var Context
     */
    protected $context;

    public function setContext(Context $context)
    {
        $this->context = $context;
    }

    abstract public function handle1(): void;

    abstract public function handle2(): void;
}

/**
 * Concrete States implement various behaviors, associated with a state of the
 * Context.
 */
class ConcreteStateA extends State
{
    public function handle1(): void
    {
        echo "ConcreteStateA handles request1.\n";
        echo "ConcreteStateA wants to change the state of the context.\n";
        $this->context->transitionTo(new ConcreteStateB());
    }

    public function handle2(): void
    {
        echo "ConcreteStateA handles request2.\n";
    }
}

class ConcreteStateB extends State
{
    public function handle1(): void
    {
        echo "ConcreteStateB handles request1.\n";
    }

    public function handle2(): void
    {
        echo "ConcreteStateB handles request2.\n";
        echo "ConcreteStateB wants to change the state of the context.\n";
        $this->context->transitionTo(new ConcreteStateA());
    }
}

/**
 * The client code.
 */
$context = new Context(new ConcreteStateA());
$context->request1();
$context->request2();
```
Output:

    Context: Transition to RefactoringGuru\State\Conceptual\ConcreteStateA.
    ConcreteStateA handles request1.
    ConcreteStateA wants to change the state of the context.
    Context: Transition to RefactoringGuru\State\Conceptual\ConcreteStateB.
    ConcreteStateB handles request2.
    ConcreteStateB wants to change the state of the context.
    Context: Transition to RefactoringGuru\State\Conceptual\ConcreteStateA.
