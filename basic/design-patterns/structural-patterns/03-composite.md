#Composite Structure Pattern

**Composite is a structural design pattern that lets you compose objects into tree structures and then work with these structures as if they were individual objects.

An Abstract Factory Pattern includes the following basic components:

- The Component interface describes operations that are common to both simple and complex elements of the tree.
- The Leaf is a basic element of a tree that doesn’t have sub-elements.
  Usually, leaf components end up doing most of the real work, since they don’t have anyone to delegate the work to..
- The Container (aka composite) is an element that has sub-elements: leaves or other containers. A container doesn’t know the concrete classes of its children. It works with all sub-elements only via the component interface.
  Upon receiving a request, a container delegates the work to its sub-elements, processes intermediate results and then returns the final result to the client.
- The Client works with all elements through the component interface. As a result, the client can work in the same way with both simple or complex elements of the tree.

Example:
```php
/**
 * The base Component class declares common operations for both simple and
 * complex objects of a composition.
 */
abstract class Component
{
    /**
     * @var Component
     */
    protected $parent;

    /**
     * Optionally, the base Component can declare an interface for setting and
     * accessing a parent of the component in a tree structure. It can also
     * provide some default implementation for these methods.
     */
    public function setParent(Component $parent)
    {
        $this->parent = $parent;
    }

    public function getParent(): Component
    {
        return $this->parent;
    }

    /**
     * In some cases, it would be beneficial to define the child-management
     * operations right in the base Component class. This way, you won't need to
     * expose any concrete component classes to the client code, even during the
     * object tree assembly. The downside is that these methods will be empty
     * for the leaf-level components.
     */
    public function add(Component $component): void { }

    public function remove(Component $component): void { }

    /**
     * You can provide a method that lets the client code figure out whether a
     * component can bear children.
     */
    public function isComposite(): bool
    {
        return false;
    }

    /**
     * The base Component may implement some default behavior or leave it to
     * concrete classes (by declaring the method containing the behavior as
     * "abstract").

/**
 * The Leaf class represents the end objects of a composition. A leaf can't have
 * any children.
 *
 * Usually, it's the Leaf objects that do the actual work, whereas Composite
 * objects only delegate to their sub-components.

    public function operation(): string
    {
        return "Leaf";

/**

    }

    /**
     * The Composite executes its primary logic in a particular way. It
     * traverses recursively through all its children, collecting and summing
     * their results. Since the composite's children pass these calls to their
     * children and so forth, the whole object tree is traversed as a result.
     */

    {
        $results = [];

    }
}

/**
 * The client code works with all of the components via the base interface.
 */
function clientCode(Component $component)
{
    // ...

```
Output:

    Client: I get a simple component:
    RESULT: Leaf
    
    Client: Now I get a composite tree:
    RESULT: Branch(Branch(Leaf+Leaf)+Branch(Leaf))
    
    Client: I don't need to check the components classes even when managing the tree::
    RESULT: Branch(Branch(Leaf+Leaf)+Branch(Leaf)+Leaf)
