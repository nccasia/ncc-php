#Strategy

**Strategy is a behavioral design pattern that lets you define a family of algorithms, put each of them into a separate class, and make their objects interchangeable.**

An Abstract Factory Pattern includes the following basic components:

1. The Context maintains a reference to one of the concrete strategies and communicates with this object only via the strategy interface.

2. The Strategy interface is common to all concrete strategies. It declares a method the context uses to execute a strategy.

3. Concrete Strategies implement different variations of an algorithm the context uses.

4. The context calls the execution method on the linked strategy object each time it needs to run the algorithm. The context doesnâ€™t know what type of strategy it works with or how the algorithm is executed.

5. The Client creates a specific strategy object and passes it to the context. The context exposes a setter which lets clients replace the strategy associated with the context at runtime.

Example:
```php
/**
 * The Context defines the interface of interest to clients.
 */
class Context
{
    /**
     * @var Strategy The Context maintains a reference to one of the Strategy
     * objects. The Context does not know the concrete class of a strategy. It
     * should work with all strategies via the Strategy interface.
     */
    private $strategy;

    /**
     * Usually, the Context accepts a strategy through the constructor, but also
     * provides a setter to change it at runtime.
     */
    public function __construct(Strategy $strategy)
    {
        $this->strategy = $strategy;
    }

    /**
     * Usually, the Context allows replacing a Strategy object at runtime.
     */
    public function setStrategy(Strategy $strategy)
    {
        $this->strategy = $strategy;
    }

    /**
     * The Context delegates some work to the Strategy object instead of
     * implementing multiple versions of the algorithm on its own.
     */
    public function doSomeBusinessLogic(): void
    {
        // ...

        echo "Context: Sorting data using the strategy (not sure how it'll do it)\n";
        $result = $this->strategy->doAlgorithm(["a", "b", "c", "d", "e"]);
        echo implode(",", $result) . "\n";

        // ...
    }
}

/**
 * The Strategy interface declares operations common to all supported versions
 * of some algorithm.
 *
 * The Context uses this interface to call the algorithm defined by Concrete
 * Strategies.
 */
interface Strategy
{
    public function doAlgorithm(array $data): array;
}

/**
 * Concrete Strategies implement the algorithm while following the base Strategy
 * interface. The interface makes them interchangeable in the Context.
 */
class ConcreteStrategyA implements Strategy
{
    public function doAlgorithm(array $data): array
    {
        sort($data);

        return $data;
    }
}

class ConcreteStrategyB implements Strategy
{
    public function doAlgorithm(array $data): array
    {
        rsort($data);

        return $data;
    }
}

/**
 * The client code picks a concrete strategy and passes it to the context. The
 * client should be aware of the differences between strategies in order to make
 * the right choice.
 */
$context = new Context(new ConcreteStrategyA());
echo "Client: Strategy is set to normal sorting.\n";
$context->doSomeBusinessLogic();

echo "\n";

echo "Client: Strategy is set to reverse sorting.\n";
$context->setStrategy(new ConcreteStrategyB());
$context->doSomeBusinessLogic();
```
Output:

    Client: Strategy is set to normal sorting.
    Context: Sorting data using the strategy (not sure how it'll do it)
    a,b,c,d,e
    
    Client: Strategy is set to reverse sorting.
    Context: Sorting data using the strategy (not sure how it'll do it)
    e,d,c,b,a
