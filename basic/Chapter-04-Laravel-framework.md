# Overview

A web framework (WF) or web application framework (WAF) is a software framework that is designed to support the development of web applications including web services, web resources, and web APIs. Web frameworks provide a standard way to build and deploy web applications on the World Wide Web.

It is a collection of packages or modules which allow developers to write Web applications (see WebApplications) or services without having to handle such low-level details as protocols, sockets or process/thread management.

## Generally, frameworks provide support for a number of activities such as

- Dependency Injection
- URL routing and interpreting requests (getting form parameters, handling cookies and sessions, authentication)
- producing responses (presenting data as HTML or in other formats)
- integrating with some frontend javascript technology (AJAX, angular, reactjs, etc)
- storing data persistently, ORM, caching and so on
- ability to run and manage migrations
- basic security features such as XSS and CRSF prevention
- support for feature or unit-testing
- Inbuilt development web server
- logging
- external modules, libraries management

# Composer

Composer is a dependency manager for PHP (similar to Bundler for Ruby apps). Composer allows developers to specify project dependencies in a composer.json file and then Composer automatically handles the rest.

Composer makes it easier to keep vendor libraries out of your repo, meaning that only application code goes in the git repository. It also makes maintaining the latest versions of all required libraries easier because you can simply run composer update to get the latest compatible packages.

 ## Installation Composer
This is the easiest way to get Composer set up on your machine.

Download and run [Composer-Setup.exe](https://getcomposer.org/Composer-Setup.exe). It will install the latest Composer version and set up your PATH so that you can call composer from any directory in your command line.

Test usage with a new terminal:
```
C:\Users\username>composer -V
Composer version 1.0.0 2016-01-10 20:34:53
```
Now that you've installed Composer, you are ready to use it!

1. Create your composer.json file to declare your dependencies.

2. The composer.json file specifies required packages.

3. Run composer install (on your local machine) to install the required packages and generate a composer.lock file.
You can even add your own code to the autoloader by adding an autoload field to composer.json

```json
{
    "autoload": {
        "psr-4": {"Ncc\\": "src/"}
    }
}
```

Composer will register a PSR-4 autoloader for the Ncc namespace.

You define a mapping from namespaces to directories. The src directory would be in your project root, on the same level as vendor directory is. An example filename would be src/Foo.php containing an Ncc\Foo class.
