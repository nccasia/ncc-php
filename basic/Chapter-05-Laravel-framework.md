# Overview

A web framework (WF) or web application framework (WAF) is a software framework that is designed to support the development of web applications including web services, web resources, and web APIs. Web frameworks provide a standard way to build and deploy web applications on the World Wide Web.

It is a collection of packages or modules which allow developers to write Web applications (see WebApplications) or services without having to handle such low-level details as protocols, sockets or process/thread management.

Generally, frameworks provide support for a number of activities such as
- URL routing and interpreting requests (getting form parameters, handling cookies and sessions, authentication)
- producing responses (presenting data as HTML or in other formats)
- integrating with some frontend javascript technology (AJAX, angular, reactjs, etc)
- storing data persistently, ORM, caching and so on
- ability to run and manage migrations
- basic security features such as XSS and CRSF prevention
- support for feature or unit-testing
- Inbuilt development web server
- logging
- external modules, libraries management

Many frameworks now provide an element of customization in their support for the above activities and abstractions, utilizing components in that they provide abstractions only for certain specific things. As a result, it can be possible for you to build your own full-stack framework almost entirely from existing components.

##5. What is MVC pattern?

MVC is an acronym which stands for 3 words Model - View - Controller. 
Source code model into 3 parts, corresponding to each word. 
Each word corresponds to a separate activity in a pattern.

**Functions of each component in the MVC model:**

**- Model (M):** The part that stores all of the application's data. 
This part is a bridge between two components below is View and Controller.
The model shown in the form is a database.
It shows operations with the database such as retrieving and processing data.

**- View (V):** This is the interface (theme) for the user. 
It is responsible for displaying data and helping users interact with the system.

**- Controller (C):** Controller is responsible for handling user requests through the view. 
From there, Controller gives the data relevant to the user. 
Besides, Controller also has the function to connect to the model.

##6. Activity flow of MVC

![Alt text](images/mvc.PNG)

- After receiving a request from the browser, Controller will interact with the model to get data. 
The model interacts with the database to get data, 
the returned data is sent back to the Model, from the Model sent back to the Controller, 
the Controller calls View to transfer the data just received from the Model to the View, 
the View will render that data to the browser.
