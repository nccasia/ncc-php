The Chrome Developer Tool is a suite of tools that are hugely supportive for developers built into Google Chrome. DevTools provides web developers with internal access to their browsers and web applications. Use DevTools to efficiently edit HTML, CSS, and JavaScript and get insights to optimize code.

**Console**

We can directly enter the js code here to run, this is a great feature to be able to test each js code individually.
The errors related to javascript (not load, syntax, ...) will show up in this tab.
