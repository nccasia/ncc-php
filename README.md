## The big picture

PHP is a server-side scripting language that is primarily used for web development. Some common areas where PHP is used include:

1. Web development: PHP is a popular choice for building dynamic web applications and websites. It is often used in combination with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create interactive and user-friendly web pages.
2. Content Management Systems (CMS): PHP is the language behind many popular open-source CMS such as WordPress, Joomla and Drupal.
3. E-commerce: PHP is a common choice for building online stores and e-commerce platforms. 
4. Web scraping and data mining: PHP can be used to extract data from websites and to automate various data mining tasks.

A senior PHP developer should have a strong understanding of the following:

1. PHP language fundamentals such as variables, data types, loops, control structures, functions, and namespaces.
2. Object-oriented programming concepts such as classes, interfaces, inheritance, and polymorphism.
3. Advanced PHP features such as closures, generators, and traits.
4. PHP web development frameworks such as Laravel, Symphony, CodeIgniter, and Yii.
5. Database management and integration, including experience with SQL and popular PHP database libraries such as PDO and MySQLi.
6. Web development best practices such as security, performance optimization, and scalability.
7. Experience with version control systems such as Git.
8. Understanding of web protocols such as HTTP, HTTPS, and REST.
9. Familiarity with front-end web development technologies such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
10. Familiarity with software development methodologies such as Agile, Scrum, and Kanban.
11. Good understanding of software development life cycle (SDLC)
12. Familiarity with cloud infrastructure like AWS, Azure, and Google Cloud.
13. Knowledge of Linux environment
14. Experience with debugging and troubleshooting complex issues.
15. Strong problem-solving skills and ability to think critically.
16. Good communication skills and ability to work well in a team.
17. Ability to learn and adapt to new technologies and programming languages quickly
18. Continuously learning and staying current with new trends and developments in PHP and related technologies.

Note that this is not an exhaustive list, but it covers many of the core skills and knowledge areas that are typically required of a senior PHP developer.
